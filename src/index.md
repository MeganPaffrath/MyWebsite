  # Hello

  My name is Megan Paffrath. I am currently a college student studying computer science.
  Aside from school, I consider learning and self development to be my biggest hobbies.
  You will never fail to find me without a personal project going.
  I have many plans for future apps and websites that I look forward to creating.
  I invite you to learn more about my journey through this very website.

## Photo Re-namer

This program utilizes exif data to figure out when a photo/video was taken.
Using that data, it changes the name of multiple photos/videos at a time to
contain the date and time the photos/videos were taken.
This program works for jpg, mp4, and MOV files.

## Simon Memory Game

The computer creates a pattern that the user must guess correctly
to move foreward. Every time the user guesses correctly, the computer
adds one more item to the pattern. The pattern gets progressively
longer until the player fails to guess the pattern properly.
This game was created as an assignment in an online course.
Also, this game is not yet available for mobile.
A mobile version may be coming soon.
